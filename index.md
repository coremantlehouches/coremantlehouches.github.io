# The school

This summer school follows the
[CIDER](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/wiki_cider/Main_Page) program with
two weeks of formal lectures and tutorials and two weeks of working on interdisciplinary
research projects in small groups. The topics are chosen by
brainstorming during the first two weeks. It is open to advanced PhD
students and postdocs. 

# Program (preliminary)

* Geodynamics: Core dynamics, mantle dynamics, core formation, geo- and palaeomagnetism, geodynamo theory, core-mantle coupling.
* Earth structure seen from its gravity field.
* Seismology: body waves, normal modes and surface waves, inverse problem theory, seismic tomography, structure near the core-mantle boundary.
* Mineral physics: Crystal structure, deformation mechanisms, ab initio calculations, physical properties of the core and mantle.
* Geochemistry: Isotopic geochemistry, heterogeneity of the mantle, evolution of the Earth, core formation, magma ocean processes.

First fortnight: Lectures, tutorials, seminars.
Second fortnight: Reseach projects in small inter-disciplinary groups, with one or two
senior researchers.

# Application and registration fee

The number of participants is limited to 50, the scientific committe will select
the participants to ensure a diversity of fields. Applicants must send
a CV with a few words on the topics of interest.

Applications will open soon (November). 

The registration fee is 1920€ (tax included) and covers the costs for
lodging and meals for the four weeks. Depending on grants we may
obtain in the next few months, we may be able to offer fellowships to
selected participants.

Participants and lecturers may bring family to the school at their own
expanse, at a rate of 64.80€/day for age above 12 and 32.40€/day
for kids between 4 and 12 years old. Baby sitters may be arranged and
full day care could be accomdated in the village
