# The school

This summer school follows the
[CIDER](https://seismo.berkeley.edu/wiki_cider/Main_Page) program with
two weeks of formal lectures and tutorials and two weeks of working on interdisciplinary
research projects in small groups. The topics are chosen by
brainstorming during the first two weeks. It is open to advanced PhD
students and postdocs. 

# Program

Core-mantle interactions from the formation of the Earth to the
present time.

Lectures on seismology, geodynamics, geomagnetism, geochemistry,
mineral physics. 

Reseach projects in small inter-disciplinary groups, with one or two
senior researchers. 

# Scientific committee

* Stéphane Labrosse, ENS de Lyon, France.
* Barbara Romanowicz, UC Berkeley, US and Collège de France.
